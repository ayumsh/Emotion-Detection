# Emotion-Detection using facial Expression

emotions have been divided into 7 basic Emotions:
Happiness, Fear, Disgust, Sadness, Neutral, Surprise, Anger.
We have taken the dataset from Kaggle. The data consists of 48x48 pixel
grayscale images of faces. The faces have been automatically registered so
that the face is more or less centered and occupies about the same amount
of space in each image.
Dataset consists of 35887 instances.
We created a 5 layer neural network to detect the emotions displayed in an
image. The initial aim of the model was to detect the emotions displayed
when we used a pre-defined data set. The model performed with satisfactory
accuracy. We then subsequently moved on to testing images that were not in
our data set.

To conclude the project, we infer that we have received satisfactory results
from this activity
We can make a machine detect human emotions just like we humans
predict by observing faces. It can have several use cases in the industry that
can prove beneficial.
Detecting the emotions using the picture of the subject is still an ongoing
researched topic, and there is so much to improve upon. Our model can
work significantly better when we fine-tune the networks used.
This can be beneficial in marketing research, where we can keep track of
how the user feels about the product, and can be used in more in-depth
interviews and game testing, to name a few.
As the data is becoming more abundant than ever, the accuracy of these
models can also be increased significantly.
